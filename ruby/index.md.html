                            **Elements of Ruby**
                            Stijn Heymans


# Introduction

I will attempt to introduce you to the elements of programming in
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) from a beginner's mindset. I will assume you
can program in some other language (Java,
[Perl](http://www.stijnheymans.net/elements_of_perl.html), Python, whatever)
and so I'll not explain recursion, object-oriented programming, or other
concepts common to most programming languages.

I will mostly use 2 sources that were helpful to me and are worth digging into yourself:

- [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/) by _why the lucky stiff_. That book is more art project than programming book, but it's also the one beginner's resource I found that gives an elemental overview of the language _with_ intuition of why things are the way they are in Ruby. If you already read that book, you can stop reading this article. You will not learn anything more than you already know.

- [Eloquent Ruby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby) by Russ Olsen. This takes things a step further and highlights the _Ruby_ way of doing common tasks, but also goes into meta-programming with Ruby that is easy to understand and gives you an inkling why Ruby might be different than some of the other languages out there.

Finally, and the source that stands a bit out, I will follow a structure that is
loosely inspired by the structure of [Introducing
Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27015358-introducing-go) by Caleb
Doxsey. It's a great little book on Go, but most of all it's a great little
_short_ book on Go that manages to bring the basics across without decorum.
Something I aspire to in this article. Let's try.

# Getting Started

# The Basic Classes

## Numbers

## Strings

## Symbols

## Booleans


# Variables

# Control Structures

# Arrays and Hashes

# Functions

# Classes and Methods

# Modules

# Testing

# Blocks

Abandoning the structure of [Introducing
Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27015358-introducing-go) to go a bit deeper into _blocks_.
