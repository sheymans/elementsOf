# Introduction

See the demo at [demo](https://github.com/sheymans/elementsOf/tree/master/docker/demo).

# The Demo App

Before we jump into containers, let's introduce the demo application, we'll be
want to run _in a container_. I'm going to use the simple web framework
[Express](expressjs.com) for [node](nodejs.org) to write an app that says `Hi`. This is a simple `hi.js`:

~~~js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (request, result) => result.send('Hi'));

app.listen(8111, () => console.log('hi: listening on port 8111'));
~~~

As I'm using `express`, I'll have a `package.json` file, that looks like this:

~~~
{
  "name": "hi",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Stijn Heymans",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
~~~

You're probably used to this, so just note that I indicated that my app will need `express` in this line:

~~~
    "express": "^4.17.1"
~~~

To make sure we can run this app, we'll install that `express` dependency as follows:

~~~bash
npm install
~~~

We use the node package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to do that. `npm`
will look at the `package.json` file, will see that there's a `dependency`
`express` and will then install `express` into the directory `node_modules`.

To start your app, then type:

~~~bash
node hi.js
~~~

You can navigate to http://localhost:8111 to be said Hi to.

Here's roughly what assumptions we made to run this app on your laptop/computer:

- Your laptop allows for running software such as `npm`, `node`.  For example, it's a Linux or Mac Os X based machine.
- You had `npm` installed to install the required dependencies of your app (`express`); if you did not have it installed, you had to go and install it.
- You then ran `npm install` from the command-line
- You had `node` installed to actually run the application
- You then ran `node hi.js` from the command-line

If you want to install and run your app on another laptop (or, on an [EC2
instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud) cause
that's how you roll), you'd repeat those steps. 

_"Well, of course, I would not repeat these steps, I'd put them all in a little
script so I just have to run the script"_. Of course you would. But you'd be
forgetten that a laptop and an EC2 instance are very different things. You'd
probably want scripts per different Operation System at the minimumn.

What if you could package your app while specifying:

- a small Operating System to start from, for example [alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/)
- an installation of `npm` and `node` layered on that
- instructions to install your application (`npm install`)
- instructions to run your application (`node hi.js`)

In other words, what if you could define a small container that specifies the
above and that you run anywhere where such containers can run? (You're getting
the container reference: a standard packaging solution that you can stuff in
there and as long as your stuff fits into a container, you can put it on a ship
and ship it off anywhere in the world).

Next up, let's see how that containerization works.
