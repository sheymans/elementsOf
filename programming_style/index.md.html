                            **Elements of Programming Style**

# Introduction

This article is taking a different approach than we have before in our other
[elements of](./elements.html) articles. Back in ancient times, probably
around 2003-2004, I found Strunk and White's [The Elements of
Style](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33514.The_Elements_of_Style). A
classic style manual for improving your writing, formulated as non-negotiable
rules. The year 2021 will go into history as the year of the P. The year I
discovered [The Elements of Programming
Style](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/454039.The_Elements_of_Programming_Style?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=oWF4aKlBCP&rank=1)
by Brian W. Kernighan and P.J. Plauger.  

_The Elements of Programming Style_ sets out to do for programming what _The
Elements of Style_ did for writing: a set of guidelines to follow when
programming, resulting in more readable code (versus more readable prose). In
fact, Kernighan and Plauger, refer to _The Elements of Style_  explicitly where
they "tried to emulate their brevity by concentrating on the essential
practical aspects of style".

Why are you reading this? Why did I write this? "What a useless endeavor.
Even in the grand scheme of useleness, it's deeply unsettling how useless this
is." I see the reader has a sense of drama. Welcome, you've come to the right
place. _The Elements of Programming Style_ was first published in 1974 and all
code examples of bad style and good style are all in
[Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) and
[PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I). While interesting historically,
this makes the bar for new readers high. This article sets out to do a reading
of the original book and chapter by chapter will try come up with modernized
examples of Kernighan and Plauger's rules. I'll pick
[Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) as the choice
of modern language as it's widely used industry (e.g., at
[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)) and should make sense to a lot of
developers living in the year 2020 (and maybe a bit beyond).

A side adventure to this journey, will be finding out how well the original
rules have held up: does a modern language like Ruby make it more difficult to
violate these rules or are the majority still relevent and in the hands of the
skillful developer to apply?

# Expression

## Say what you mean, simply and directly

Let's start by looking at the following program:

~~~ruby
    sig { params(x: Integer, y: Integer, z: Integer).returns(Integer)}
    def self.f(x, y, z)
        if x <= y
            if x <= z
                return x
            end
            return z
        end
        if y <= z
            return y
        end
        z
    end
~~~
