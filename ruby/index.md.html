# Introduction

I will introduce you to the elements of programming in
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). I assume you can program in some other
language such as Java,
[Perl](http://www.stijnheymans.net/elements_of_perl.html), Python, Go, ...

Background sources that were helpful to me:

- [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/) by _why the lucky
  stiff_. More art project than programming book, but a beginner's resource
  that gives an elemental overview of the language _with_ intuition of the Ruby
  language.  If you read that book, you can stop reading this article. There's
  nothing here for you.

- [Eloquent Ruby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby) by
  Russ Olsen. A bit more advanced than _Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby_. The
  book ventures into meta-programming with Ruby. To see what sets Ruby apart, I
  recommend this book.

In this article, I will follow a structure that is loosely inspired by the
structure of [Introducing
Go](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27015358-introducing-go) by Caleb
Doxsey. Not a Ruby book, but a Go, book. It's a _short_ book on Go that manages
to bring the basics across.  Something I will aspire to in this article, for
Ruby.

# Getting Started

On the command-line, check whether Ruby is installed:

~~~shell
$ ruby --version
~~~

For me, this shows `ruby 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580)
[universal.x86_64-darwin20]`). If you don't have Ruby installed, get it at [the
ruby-lang website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

If you have Ruby installed, you also have an interactive interpreter called
[irb](https://github.com/ruby/irb). On the command-line, type `irb`.

~~~
irb> puts 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
=> nil
~~~

Leave the interactive interpreter `irb` by typing `exit`. Now let's a `Hello World!` again, but
without `irb`. Open a file (make it end on `rb`, for example
`ruby_playground.rb`) and write the following line in it:

~~~ruby
puts 'Hello World!'
~~~

Close the file and at the command-line, have Ruby execute it:

~~~
$ ruby ruby_playground.rb
Hello World!
~~~

Do you want to know more about `puts`? Get in the habit of using the [official
docs](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/).  Pick the right version of the docs
corresponding to what you saw in your initial `ruby --version`. I picked
`2.6.0` as my Ruby version is `2.6.3` and found this
[explanation](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/ARGF.html#method-i-puts).

# The Basic Classes

## Numbers

Unsurprisingly, integers are represented as we expect: `3`, `5`, `-100`, ...
Surprisingly, everything in Ruby is an object so you can ask the class of an
integer: `5.class`. This returns
[Integer](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Integer.html). 

Since integers are objects there's more fun stuff one can ask them: 

~~~
irb> 123.digits
=> [3, 2, 1]
~~~

Fans of coding interviews will appreciate this. That's the only place you will
ever need that.

Simple math is ready for you and has been since you were 7:

~~~
irb> 1 + 2
=> 3
irb> 2 * 3
=> 6
irb> 8 / 4
=> 2
~~~

There's also the number type that keeps it real and inexact, le
[Float](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Float.html). In its literal
representation, it's _things_ that contain a decimal point:`1.0`, `9.9999`, ...

~~~
irb> 1.0.class
=> Float
~~~

First encounters are frequently unpleasant:

~~~
irb> 7 / 2
=> 3
~~~

Dividing 2 integers results in integer division. Force one to be a `Float`
using `to_f`:

~~~
irb> 7.to_f / 2
=> 3.5
~~~

## Strings

String are characters surrounded by single quotes or double quotes: `'Hello'`
or `"Hello"`. The double-quoted variety is special. More later. Be patient.

Use `+` to concatenate 2 strings without changing the original strings. Use
`<<` to concanate and destroy the string you're appending to:

~~~
irb> a = "hello"
=> "hello"
irb> b = "world"
=> "world"
irb> a + b
=> "helloworld"
irb> a
=> "hello"
irb> b
=> "world"
irb> a << b
=> "helloworld"
irb> a
=> "helloworld"
irb> b
=> "world"
~~~

Pull characters out of a String:

~~~
irb> a = "hello"
=> "hello"
irb> a[0]
=> "h"
irb> a[-1]
=> "o"
~~~

You can get substrings by using inclusive (`..`) or exclusive (`...`) ranges:

~~~
irb> a = "hello"
=> "hello"
irb> a[0..2]
=> "hel"
irb> a[0...2]
=> "he"
~~~

## Symbols

Symbols consist of letters, digits, or underscores, and are preceded by a `:` .
For example, `:a`, `:a_2`, `:an_orange`. Why not just use Strings? [Great
question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/255078/whats-the-difference-between-a-string-and-a-symbol-in-ruby).

Let's explore how strings are different from symbols by asking for their
`object_id`:

~~~
irb> "bar".object_id
=> 70236502854760
irb> "bar".object_id
=> 70236502887440
irb> :foo.object_id
=> 1516508
irb> :foo.object_id
=> 1516508
~~~

From that `irb` session, you can (if you truly want) learn that

- every object has a method `object_id` that returns _some_ id.
- strings that appear the same do not necessarily have the same `object_id`, which _probably_ has memory consequences
- symbols that appear the same have the same `object_id`, which _probably_ has memory consequences

## Booleans

`true` and `false`. This section seems awfully incomplete doesn't it? It's not.

# Variables

Like symbols they consist of letters, digits, or underscores. Unlike symbols,
they do not start with colons. You initialize them:

~~~
irb> x = 'hello'
=> "hello"
irb> x = 5
=> 5
irb> x = true
=> true
~~~

I assigned and re-assigned that `x` to my heart's content with different values
_and_ different types.

You feel resistance. "But this is insane," you say. You do not like it and you
want the world to know it. You take the matter to twitter, but twitter is just
an empty army of machines.  No-one listens, not truly, not anymore. It's 2021
kid, the humans lost.

And as far as single and double quotes go: 

~~~
irb> x = 2
=> 2
irb> "we were #{x}"
=> "we were 2"
irb> 'we were #{x}'
=> "we were \#{x}"
~~~

[String interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) yes.

And sometimes variables are not so variable:

~~~
irb> X = 5
=> 5
irb> X = 6
(irb):5: warning: already initialized constant X
~~~

Capitalize your variable and it becomes _constant_. 

A word on camels and snakes when naming variables or really anything. Use snake
case almost everywhere: `lowercase_words_separated_by_underscores`. Except
`ClassNames`, go for camel case there. Later more on classes.

# Control Structures

## Conditions and `if`

Here's the basic form of an `if`:

~~~ruby
if condition
  do_something
end
~~~

So no parentheses as in `(condition)`, no colon as in `condition:`, no curly brackets
as in `{ do_something }`). And `end` to end it.

The usual `else if` and `else`:

~~~ruby
if condition
  do_something
elsif other_condition
  do_something_else
else
  final_thing_you_can_do
end
~~~

Conditions in `if` statements are expressions that evaluate to true or false.
What expressions evaluates to true?

- all numbers (including `0`) are true
- all strings (including `''` -- the empty string) are true
- `nil` (yep, that's a null right there) is false
- the boolean literal `true` is true
- the boolean literal `false` is false
- the boolean expression `a && b` is true if `a` and `b` are true
- the boolean expression `a || b` is true if `a` or `b` are true
- the boolean expression `!a` is true if a is not true

Your conditions will often compare things: if variable `a` is equal to `"dog"`,
then do this. While Ruby has `==`, `===`, `equal?`, and `eql?`, you
will mostly use:

- `==` for checking whether values are equal as far as the class designer of the objects you're comparing is concerned. 
- `equal?` for checking object equality.

In fact, `equal?` and `==` as defined in the
[`Object`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Object.html#method-i-eql-3F) are
equal. Pun intended.

The intent is that class designers override `==` to something that
makes sense for the class, but that `equal?` always stands for object
equality. Take the `String` class:

~~~
irb> "a" == "a"
=> true
irb> "a".equal?("a")
=> false
~~~

So `"a"` is equal to `"a"` as values, but, as we saw before, they're not the same
objects. However, for symbols:

~~~
irb> :a == :a
=> true
irb> :a.equal?(:a)
=> true
~~~

Back to our `if` for a bit. Instead of:

~~~ruby
if !condition
  do_something
end
~~~

write:

~~~ruby
unless condition
  do_something
end
~~~

Furthermore, if `do_something` is just one line, Ruby often prefers the one-liner:

~~~ruby
do_something if condition
~~~

or

~~~ruby
do_something unless condition
~~~

Especially when returning early from functions, this makes code readable:

~~~ruby
return if invalid_parameters
~~~

## Looping

Take a look at a relatively standard loop-pattern in programming. For example, this `go` loop:

~~~go
n := 5
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
  fmt.Println(i)
}
~~~

This prints:

~~~
0
1
2
3
4
~~~

There's a variety of ways to write this in Ruby, but the above classic `for`
construct is not one of them.  Closest in spirit is to
use a `while`:

~~~ruby
n = 5
i = 0
while i < n
  puts i
  i += 1
end
~~~

This is more verbose than the corresponding `for` loop in `go`.
More idiomatic Ruby uses [`times`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Integer.html#method-i-times):

~~~ruby
n.times { |i| puts i }
~~~

More elegant than the clunky `while`.  Deconstruct this expression:

- `n`. An `Integer`, and thus an object that has methods.
- `times`. A [method](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Integer.html#method-i-times) that is called on the object `n` and _iterates_ the following block `{ |i| puts i}` from `0` to `n - 1`, passing in those values to `i` with each iteration. More on blocks later, but for those familiar, the block is essentially an anonymous function or lambda with parameter `i` (or arrow function for the Javascript knowledgeables). 
- `{ |i| puts i }`. We spoiled it. This is a `block` that prints `i` with `i` ranging over values `0` to `n - 1`. This _ranging over values_ is accomplished by `times`. We'll see later how we can write functions such as `times` ourselves in the section on Blocks. For now, you can see `times` as an higher-order function that takes another function as an argument.

Most of the time your looping will be in the context of some collection so I'll
talk more about looping in that section.

# Collections

## Arrays

An array is an [ordered integer-indexed collection](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Array.html) of objects. Let's initialize one:

~~~
irb> a = ["x", 1, :y]
=> ["x", 1, :y]
~~~

Arrays are not restricted to contain only 1 type of objects. You can shove
in there what you like: 

~~~
irb> a = ["x", [1, 2], :y]
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y]
~~~

The usual suspects with a special mention for `-1` (the last of the elements):

~~~
irb> a = ["x", [1, 2], :y]
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y]
irb> a.length
=> 3
irb> a[1]
=> [1, 2]
irb> a[-1]
=> :y
~~~

You can add elements to the back of an array using `<<` or `push`. Both are destructive operations:

~~~
irb> a << :b
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y, :b]
irb> a.push(:c)
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y, :b, :c]
irb> a
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y, :b, :c]
~~~

You can remove that last element again using `pop`:

~~~
irb> l = a.pop
=> :c
irb> a
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y, :b]
~~~

What about adding and removing to the _front_ of an array? Use `unshift` and `shift`. As far as unsavory mnemonics go, remove the `f` to remember which does what.

~~~
irb> a
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y, :b]
irb> f = a.shift
=> "x"
irb> a
=> [[1, 2], :y, :b]
irb> a.unshift("x_new")
=> ["x_new", [1, 2], :y, :b]
~~~

`pop/push` must be more efficient than `shift/unshift`? Seems it [hardly
matters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8353026/what-is-the-run-time-of-shift-unshift-in-a-ruby-array).

What if you have a second array `b = [:b1, :b2]` that you want to append (i.e., add each element) to `a`? Just using `push` will not do what you want:

~~~
irb> a = ["x", [1, 2], :y]
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y]
irb> b = [:b1, :b2]
=> [:b1, :b2]
irb> a.push(b)
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y, [:b1, :b2]]
~~~

However, using the _splat_ operator `*` will:

~~~
irb> b = [:b1, :b2]
=> [:b1, :b2]
irb> a.push(*b)
=> ["x", [1, 2], :y, :b1, :b2]
~~~

`*b` for an array `b` in the context of a function call (`push` here) will send
each element of the array as an individual argument to the function. Thus,
`a.push(*b)` is the same as `a.push(:b1, :b2)`.

I initialized arrays using their literal form (such as `a = [1, 2]`).  I can
also initialize them using the `new` method from the
[Array](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Array.html) class:

~~~
irb> a = Array.new
=> []
irb> a << 1
=> [1]
~~~

## Hashes

[Hashes](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Hash.html) are structures that store
key-value pairs with unique keys (also called dictionaries, associative arrays,
`HashMap`, maps in other languages). You can use any object type as a key.

Let's define a hash with some personal information and get a
value for an existing/non-existing key, change a value for an existing
key, add a value for a non-existing key, and remove a key/value pair:

~~~
irb> a = { "first" => "John", "last" => "Doe" }
=> {"first"=>"John", "last"=>"Doe"}
irb> a["first"]
=> "John"
irb> a["nothere"]
=> nil
irb> a["first"] = "Jane"
=> "Jane"
irb> a
=> {"first"=>"Jane", "last"=>"Doe"}
irb> a["first"]
=> "Jane"
irb> a["nothere"] = "now it is here"
=> "now it is here"
irb> a
=> {"first"=>"Jane", "last"=>"Doe", "nothere"=>"now it is here"}
irb> a.delete("nothere")
=> "now it is here"
irb> a
=> {"first"=>"Jane", "last"=>"Doe"}
~~~

What type of objects can be values? Any object.
What type of objects can be keys, surely only strings right? Any object.

In the above rundown, all keys were strings. When keys are symbols, there's
some syntactic sugar that tastes almost like the real thing:

~~~
irb> a = { :first => "John", :last => "Doe" }
=> {:first=>"John", :last=>"Doe"}
irb> a[:first]
=> "John"
~~~

Nothing interesting happened. You used symbols `:first` and `:last` as keys.
However, if you want symbols as keys, you can party as wild as JSON does on
Friday night, evoking nothing but bleak memories of what used to be a life with
promise:

~~~
irb> a = { first: "John", last: "Doe" }
=> {:first=>"John", :last=>"Doe"}
~~~

I confidently said you can use any object as a hash key. This relies on properly
overriding `hash` and `eql?` (the latter being what
[Hash](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Hash.html) uses for testing equality
of keys. [Two objects will then refer to the same key when their `hash` value
is identical and the 2 objects `eql?` each
other](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Hash.html#class-Hash-label-Hash+Keys).
Is this still elemental? Probably not. Moving on.

## Looping through Arrays and Hashes

You will spend half of your life looping through arrays and hashes. Given an array:

~~~
a = [100, 200, 300]
~~~

Print each element:

~~~
a.each { |el| puts el }
~~~

No `for` in sight. Use `each` when you can. `each` iterates through the
elements of the array and binds each of those elements to _el_ in the block `{
|el| puts el }`, and then executes the `puts el`. If you need more than a
one-liner, do use `do...end`:

~~~ruby
a.each do |el|
  puts el
  puts el
end
~~~

Sometimes you want the index as well as the element (mostly in interviews, in
real life not so much). So similar to the trickery we saw before you could do:

~~~ruby
a.length.times { |i| puts a[i] }
~~~

However, the thought police favors `each_with_index`:

~~~
irb> a.each_with_index { |el, i| puts "#{i}: #{el}" }
0: 100
1: 200
2: 300
~~~

Yeah, get those [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) out to memorize
the order of that `|el, i|`. You did not ask for it, but here's a tip: in Ruby, it often works to
ask "how would I say this out loud?". 

!!!
   In the array `a`, for _each_ `el` at index `i`, do something. 

If your intuition is _for each index `i` which has element `el`_, change your
intuition.

You can loop over a hash with `each`:

~~~
irb> a = { first: "John", last: "Doe" }
=> {:first=>"John", :last=>"Doe"}
irb> a.each { |key, value|  puts "#{key} -> #{value}" }
first -> John
last -> Doe
~~~

Sometimes you only want to loop through the keys or values of a hash. You can
use `keys` and `values`:

~~~
irb> a.keys
=> [:first, :last]
irb> a.values
=> ["John", "Doe"]
~~~

In contrast to hashes in other languages (e.g. `HashMap` in Java), you _can_
assume an order on key-value pairs. They will be in the order they were
inserted:

~~~
irb> a = {}
=> {}
irb> a["first"] = 1
=> 1
irb> a["second"] = 2
=> 2
irb> a.each { |key, value|  puts "#{key} -> #{value}" }
first -> 1
second -> 2
~~~

Sometimes you can benefit from going one abstraction higher than pure looping,
and use a [`map`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Array.html#method-i-map):

~~~
irb> a = [1, 2, 3]
=> [1, 2, 3]
irb> b = a.map { |x| x * 2 }
=> [2, 4, 6]
irb> a
=> [1, 2, 3]
~~~

If you do not want a new array, you can use the [destructive variant
`map!`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Array.html#method-i-map-21):

~~~
irb> a.map! { |x| x * 2 }
=> [2, 4, 6]
irb> a
=> [2, 4, 6]
~~~

I know you saw the exclamation mark. That was not an indication of surprise (_"a `map` here?!"_). The convention in Ruby is to append `!` to function names if those
functions are supposed to be destructive. The exclamation mark is a regular
part of the function name.

We can also map hashes. For example, collect all keys of a map, but uppercased:

~~~
irb> a = { first: "John", last: "Doe" }
=> {:first=>"John", :last=>"Doe"}
irb> a.map { |key, value| key.upcase }
=> [:FIRST, :LAST]
~~~

What if you want to map a Hash to a Hash, but just keeping the keys but
uppercasing the values?

~~~
irb> a.map { |key, value| [key, value.upcase] }.to_h
=> {:first=>"JOHN", :last=>"DOE"}
~~~

The `map` returns an array of `[key, value.upcase]` arrays. So I use `to_h` to
convert that very specific array to a hash.  Generally:

~~~
irb> [[1, 2], [3, 4]].to_h
=> {1=>2, 3=>4}
~~~

We're verging to the non-elemental.

# Functions

Functions (or _methods_, when appearing in classes, same potato) have this
shape:

~~~ruby
def function_name(arg1, arg2,...)
  # do stuff
end
~~~

Functions start with `def` and end with `end`. A function that doubles every
element in an array:

~~~ruby
def double_all(a)
  a.map { |x| x * 2 }
end
~~~

"Oh no," you say. "They forgot to type the arguments." Yes. That `a` can be
anything as long as it understands `map`. 

Calling functions is as you would expect:

~~~
irb> a = [1, 2, 3]
irb> puts double_all(a)
2
4
6
~~~

If you miss types, or you work in a large code base with many developers and
you prefer sanity over insanity, check out [sorbet](https://sorbet.org/). Sorbet
allows you to annotate your functions with type information. For example, the
above could be:

~~~ruby
sig { params(a: T::Array[Integer].returns(T::Array[Integer]) }
def double_all(a)
  a.map { |x| x * 2 }
end
~~~

This indicates that `double_all` takes in an array of integers `a` and returns
an array of integers.

You can have defaults for your arguments:

~~~ruby
def double_all(a = [1, 2])
  a.map { |x| x * 2 }
end
~~~

You can then leave off the argument to `double_all`:

~~~
irb> puts double_all
2
4
~~~

A function with a Hash as an argument:

~~~ruby
def hash_keys(h)
  puts "a: #{h[:a]}"
  puts "b: #{h[:b]}"
end
~~~

And then:

~~~
irb> puts hash_keys({ a: 1, b: 2 })
a: 1
b: 2
~~~

If a hash is the last argument of the function call, you can leave off the
curly braces:

~~~
irb> puts hash_keys(a: 1, b: 2)
a: 1
b: 2
~~~

That looks a lot like keyword arguments. Indeed,  you can now change the
calling order:

~~~
irb> puts hash_keys(b: 2, a: 1)
a: 1
b: 2
~~~

# Classes and Methods

You can define a minimal class with the `class` keyword, a name, and `end`:

~~~ruby
class A

end
~~~

This does not do more then introduce `A` into the world.  Let's see how to
create a new `A` object `a`, how to ask its `object_id`, how to get its String
representation with `to_s`, and finally how to get an object's class:

~~~
irb> a = A.new
=> #<A:0x00007f913a9bb5e0>
irb> a.to_s
=> "#<A:0x00007f913a9bb5e0>"
irb> a.object_id
=> 70130865134320
irb> a.class
=> A
~~~

Not bad for a minute of work. You may be wondering why a minimal `A` object can
do all of this.  Poke at the class hierarchy:

~~~
irb> a.class.ancestors
=> [A, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
~~~

So `a` is an `A` which is an `Object` which is a `Kernel`, which is a
`BasicObject`. Forget about the latter 2. You've forgotten it.  `Object` has
the functionality that we saw on the `A` object. We're tapping into _inherited_
methods from `Object`:

~~~
irb> o = Object.new
=> #<Object:0x00007f913a82f898>
irb> o.to_s
=> "#<Object:0x00007f913a82f898>"
irb> o.object_id
=> 70130864323660
irb> o.class
=> Object
irb> o.class.ancestors
=> [Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
~~~

You may be used to defining _constructors_ in classes that get called when
creating objects using `new`. With a minimal class like `A` we use the
`initialize` of `Object`. If you want to use your own _constructor_ you can
define your own `initialize`:

~~~ruby
class A

  def initialize
    puts "you called new!"
  end

end
~~~

Creating a new `A`:

~~~
irb> a = A.new
you called new!
=> #<A:0x00007fc4eb1b8bd8>
~~~

Right now, the class `A` is mostly useless. Usually classes carry some _state_ (cars have
doors and color, some cars have 4 doors, some 5, some cars are blue, some cars
are yellow). We capture that state using instance variables.

In Ruby, instance variables start with an `@`. Give `A` some state:

~~~ruby
class A

  def initialize
    @a = 10
  end

  def print_your_state
    puts "my state is #{@a}"
  end

end
~~~

I did two new things:

- I've set the value of `@a` in the `initialize`. Given what you know at this point, you know that when you create a new `A` object that the `@a = 10` line gets executed
- I've introduced an _instance_method_ called `print_your_state`. If you have an `A` object called `x` you can do `x.print_your_state`. This will execute the `puts` line for your object `x`.

~~~
irb> x = A.new
=> #<A:0x00007fc4ea1190c0 @a=10>
irb> x.print_your_state
my state is 10
~~~

Every object has `@a` equal to 10. Useless as far as state goes for objects. You want to
create objects with different states. Give 
`initialize` arguments that indicate the state you want to give the object:

~~~ruby
class A

  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end

  def print_your_state
    puts "my state is #{@a}"
  end

end
~~~

~~~
irb> x = A.new(10)
=> #<A:0x00007fc4eb1c1f80 @a=10>
irb> y = A.new(11)
=> #<A:0x00007fc4e9832c40 @a=11>
irb> x.print_your_state
my state is 10
irb(main):014:0> y.print_your_state
my state is 11
~~~

On the topic of arguments, you can of course also give instance methods
arguments:

~~~ruby
class A

  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end

  def print_your_state_with_a_factor(x)
    result = @a * x
    puts "my state is #{result}"
  end
~~~

And then:

~~~
irb> x = A.new(10)
=> #<A:0x00007fc4eb145778 @a=10>
irb> x.print_your_state_with_a_factor(3)
my state is 30
~~~

Note that `result` is a _local_ variable to the instance method
`print_your_state_with_a_factor` and thus there's no `@` in sight when `put`ing
it.

Instance variables are _encapsulated_. You cannot get to their value from
outside the class:

~~~
irb> x = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fc8cc180280 @a=3>
irb> x.a
Traceback (most recent call last):
        4: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        3: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `load'
        2: from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/gems/irb-1.0.0/exe/irb:11:in `<top (required)>'
        1: from (irb):4
NoMethodError (undefined method `a' for #<A:0x00007fc8cc180280 @a=3>)
~~~

Ruby's instance variables are thus by default a bit like private instance
variables in Java. If you want direct access to the instance variable, you need
to define a getter:

~~~ruby
class A

  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end

  def a
    @a
  end
end
~~~

And then:

~~~
irb> x = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007f913a943c70 @a=3>
irb> x.a
=> 3
~~~

You could still not write directly to `@a` as that requires a _setter_:

~~~
irb> x.a = 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
        4: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        3: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `load'
        2: from /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/gems/irb-1.0.0/exe/irb:11:in `<top (required)>'
        1: from (irb):20
NoMethodError (undefined method `a=' for #<A:0x00007f913a943c70 @a=3>)
Did you mean?  a
~~~

We can write this ourselves:

~~~ruby
class A

  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end

  def a
    @a
  end

  def a=(a)
    @a = a
  end
end
~~~

and then:

~~~
irb> x = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fb09b838558 @a=3>
irb> x.a
=> 3
irb> x.a = 5
=> 5
irb> x.a
=> 5
~~~

I'll pause, so you can take this in.

~~~ruby
def a=(a)
  @a = a
end
~~~

That latter is an [assignment
method](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/doc/syntax/assignment_rdoc.html#label-Assignment+Methods).
At this point the whole thing has has become an ordeal. Luckily, we have
shorthand for the getter and setter by using `attr_accessor` as follows:

~~~ruby
class A
  attr_accessor :a

  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end
end
~~~

Yes, you write `:a` there. 

~~~
irb> x = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fc5ab109988 @a=3>
irb> x.a
=> 3
irb> x.a = 6
=> 6
~~~

If you only want the getter, you can use `attr_reader`. If you only want a
setter (who are you?), you can use `attr_writer`.

What do you think will `x == y` be in the below?

~~~
irb> x = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fa3d6194778 @a=3>
irb> y = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fa3d58ed458 @a=3>
irb> x == y
~~~

That's right. False. `x` and `y` are different objects and `==` is using
`Object` equality in this case. Sometimes it makes sense, to have `x` and `y`
be equal as they represent the same data namely an `A` with state `3`. For
example, for Strings: `"I am right" == "I am right"` are the same strings and
violating this expectation would be shocking to all but the most hardened
developers.

You can override `==` in `A` to get equality based on state, rather than on
object identity:

~~~ruby
class A
  attr_accessor :a

  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end

  def ==(other)
    self.a == other.a
  end
end
~~~

And then:

~~~
irb> x = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fb47c1805a0 @a=3>
irb> y = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fb47c189268 @a=3>
irb> x == y
=> true
~~~

Couple of things worth pointing to:

- `==` can is an instance method defined as any other method.  The reason is that `x == y`, is really just `x.==(y)` as if `==` is any other method name.
- I used `self` which is very similar to Java's `this` at least in _this_ [context](https://airbrake.io/blog/ruby/self-ruby-overview). Here it's an instance of this object itself. So when doing `x == y`, and we thus execute `==` for the object `x`, then `self` is `x`. Caveat emptor: `self` may mean other things. We will see in a bit how to use `self` to define _class methods_. 
- I did not actually have to use `self` here. There is no ambiguity if I would do `a == other.a`. The first `a` refers to the method `a` defined in `A` (by way of the `attr_accessor`) and allows me to check equality of the instance variable `@a` with `other.a` (aka the `@a` of the `other` object). You are right to think that I could do `@a == other.a` directly. But why make it simple when you can make it complicated?

If you know `Java`, you must have met `static`. _static variables or methods_
in Java classes indicate that they belong to the class rather than the
instance.

In Ruby _class variables_ are indicated with `@@` (recall that instance
variables are indicated with `@`). _Class methods_ are indicated by preceding
the name with `self`. The body is not yet cold and here we are: `self` in this
context refers to the class (rather than the object). An example: 

~~~ruby
class A
  @@counter = 0

  def initialize
    @@counter += 1
  end

  def self.counter
    @@counter
  end

end
~~~

And then:

~~~
irb> x = A.new
=> #<A:0x00007fc82595ce60>
irb> A.counter
=> 1
irb> y = A.new
=> #<A:0x00007fc8259642a0>
irb> A.counter
=> 2
~~~

Note that we asked `A` for the `counter` (not `x`, nor `y`). In fact, doing
`x.counter` would lead to an `undefined method` error.

I avoided it for a while, but sometimes you have to talk about inheritance. In
the below I make `B` a subclass of `A` by indicating `B < A`.

~~~ruby
class A
  attr_accessor :a

  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end

  def double
    2 * @a
  end
end

class B < A
  def triple
    3 * @a
  end
end
~~~

Poke around:

~~~
irb> x = A.new(3)
=> #<A:0x00007fa19e02dd10 @a=3>
irb> x.double
=> 6
irb> y = B.new
Traceback (most recent call last):
        6: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        5: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `load'

=> #<B:0x00007fa19f2184a8 @a=5>
irb> y.double

irb> y.triple

~~~

If you're familiar with inheritance, this looks encouraging. Some points to emphasize:

- I did not define an `initialize` for `B` so we're forced to use the one of `A` which requires 1 argument `a`
- I accessed the instance variable `@a` in `B. This sometimes leads to surprises, but I hope you have a good [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) going for you

# Modules

The syntax of a module is easy. Use keyword `module`, give it a name, and end with `end`:

~~~ruby
module HomeMade
  class A
    attr_accessor :a

    def initialize(a)
      @a = a
    end

    def double
      2 * @a
    end
  end

end
~~~

Prepend `HomeMade::` to your class name `A` if you want an instance of the `A`
in the `HomeMade` module:

~~~
irb> a = HomeMade::A.new(3)
=> #<HomeMade::A:0x00007fdf07147448 @a=3>
irb> a.double
=> 6
~~~

## As Namespaces

Why modules? Because your neighbor also wants a class with name `A`. That's how
your neighbor is. Modules provide little name islands of peace and quiet:

~~~ruby
module HomeMade
  class A
    attr_accessor :a

    def initialize(a)
      @a = a
    end

    def double
      2 * @a
    end
  end
end

module NeighborMade
  class A
    # Same name A
  end
end
~~~

You can then pick your `A` without conflict:

~~~
irb> a = HomeMade::A.new(3)
=> #<HomeMade::A:0x00007f95eb03f0b0 @a=3>
irb> b = NeighborMade::A.new
=> #<NeighborMade::A:0x00007f95ef0ef998>
~~~

Modules help you to logically organize your classes/functions within your
application.

## As Mixins

Imagine (imagine!) you have 2 modules, 1 for logging and 1 for doing more
long-term analytics (for example, for sending Kafka events):

~~~ruby
module Logger
  def log_it(what)
    puts what
  end
end

module Analytics
  def send_event(event)
    puts event
  end
end
~~~

And you have a class `A` that would like to use the methods from both the `Logger` and `Analytics` modules:

~~~ruby
class A

  def do_something
    log_it("we're logging this")
    send_event('for long term analytics we send this')
  end

end
~~~

If you try `a.do_something` for an object `a` of type `A`, you get a
`NoMethodError` for `log_it` and `send_event`. You are very smart (your
grandmother told you so), and you say, "let `A` inherit from `Logger`."  Yes,
give me more of that smartness. What a joy.  And "also let `A` inherit from
`Analytics`." So much goodness. Wonderful.

Ruby does not allow for multiple inheritance. You can only inherit from 1 class
(ignoring for a minute that `Logger` and `Analytics` are not actually classes,
they are modules).

We (I say _We_ but I really mean _I_; you have turned out a massive
disappointment; and you also thought the semi-colon is dead; it's not) can
solve this by _mixing in_ the 2 modules in the class `A` by using `include`:

~~~ruby
class A
  include Logger
  include Analytics

  def do_something
    log_it("we're logging this")
    send_event('for long term analytics we send this')
  end
end
~~~

`include` makes all methods of the modules available as _instance_ methods in
your class. In the Java world, and maybe other worlds as well, you are reminded
immediately of the dreaded Utility class.

# Testing

Say you have a class `A` that doubles, defined in a file `ruby_playground.rb`:

~~~ruby
class A
  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
  end

  def double
    @a * 2
  end
end
~~~

Let's unit test `double` by creating a new file `test_ruby_playground.rb` for it:

~~~ruby
require 'test/unit'
require './ruby_playground'

class RubyPlayGroundTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_double
    a = A.new(3)
    assert_equal 6, a.double
  end

end
~~~

This should look fairly familiar by now. Some new things:

- we `require` the `test/unit` Ruby gem which defines the class `Test::Unit::TestCase` for us.
- we `require` the file that has our own `A` with its `double`
- we create a new class `RubyPlayGroundTest` that inherits from that `Test::Unit::TestCase`
- we write a method that starts with `test_` and we use `assert_equal` to test whether `6` is indeed the result of `a.double`.

Running that test file should result in success with statistics:

~~~
$ ruby test_ruby_playground.rb
Loaded suite test_ruby_playground
Started

Finished in 0.000298 seconds.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~~~

Try making the test fail and run the test again. Do it.

# Blocks


A quick reminder that we already saw blocks in action:

~~~
irb> a = [1, 2, 3]
=> [1, 2, 3]
irb> a.map { |el| el * 2 }
=> [2, 4, 6]
~~~

The piece `{ |el| el * 2 } is a _block_. You can distinguish the parameter part
`|el|` as well as the _body_ of that block `el * 2`. For multi-line blocks,
you'd use the `do...end` form, same potato though:

~~~ruby
a.map do |el|
 double = el * 2
 double + 1
end
~~~

Essentially you're giving one function `map` another function (the block) as an
argument. It's what they call higher-order functions in school children.

How do you define your own higher order function? Let's define a function that starts by printing "here we are now", and ends by printing "entertain us" to whatever function call we'd like. For example, say we want to print those 2 lines around a function call of `lost`:

~~~ruby
def lost
  puts 'a lost generation'
end
~~~

We could of course just do:

~~~ruby
puts 'here we are now'
lost
puts 'entertain us'
~~~

But if I'd want to do the same to another function than `lost` I'd have to repeat that. Let's define a higher-function that can prints those things for any other function:

~~~
def smells_like
  puts 'here we are now'
  yield
  puts 'entertain us'
end
~~~

You saw it: `yield`. That keyword tells the function `smells_like` _and now
execute the block that was given to your call my friend_. So if we do
`smells_like { lost }`, you see:

```
here we are now
a lost generation
entertain us
```

You could also just do `smells_like { puts 'a broken generation' }` and see:

```
here we are now
a broken generation
entertain us
```

What about blocks with parameters? For example, what if I want to be able to do
`smells_like('broken') { |x| puts "a #{x} generation" }`? `yield` can take
arguments, and yields arguments get shuttled into the block's arguments:

~~~ruby
def smells_like(something)
  puts 'here we are now'
  yield(something)
  puts 'entertain us'
end
~~~

And then:

~~~
irb> smells_like('lost') { |x| puts "a #{x} generation" }
here we are now
a lost generation
entertain us
irb> smells_like('broken') { |x| puts "a #{x} generation" }
here we are now
a broken generation
entertain us
~~~

Good times.
