## Strings

### Basic Usage

Scalars or scalar values are typically the smallest unit of data type in perl, for example numbers and strings.

Generally, we'll store scalars in variables as follows:

~~~perl
my $var = 'I am a string';
~~~

The `my` in this part _declares_ the variable (similar to a `let` in
Javascript), and `$var` consists of the symbol `$` and the name `var`. The
latter is one of the things to get used to when switching from
python/javascript to perl, the symbol `$` hints at how the variable is used or accessed. In
this case, it declares and initializes a string, which is a scalar, and thus
the symbol `$` emphasizes that.

You'll later see symbols `@` for array usage and `%` for hash usage (a `hash`
is python's `dict` or generally a key-value structure such as a `Map` in Java).

Back to strings, you'll from to time want to concatenate 2 strings:

~~~perl
my $concat = $var . ' and me too.';
~~~

!!! note
   _statements_ in perl end with `;` as they do in Java or C++.


If you'd like to change `$var` by concatenating something to it, instead of `$var = $var . ' and me too.'` you can do:

~~~perl
$var .= ' and me too.';
~~~

You have spotted the single quotes for strings, and are wondering _what about
double quotes?_. You can use double quotes as well. Good practice is them only
when you want to _interpolate_ variables in them. For example:

~~~perl
my $name = 'stijn';
~~~

Interpolation will now make sure that `$name` in that `$hello` string is always
_expanded_ to its value. In this case, it will be `my name is stijn`.
Interpolation will usually lead to cleaner code than concatenation:

~~~perl
my $name = 'stijn';
my $hello = "my name is $name";
my $hello_conc = "my name is " . $name; 
~~~

Why is it good practice to only use them when you actually want to interpolate variables? Imagine I have 

~~~perl
my $money = "my password is !$guest";
~~~

In this case `perl` will try to expand `$guest` which does not exist and will result in warning and an unexpected result in `$money`.

You actually meant:

~~~perl
my $money = 'my password is !$guest';
~~~

### Useful built-in Functions

## Numbers

### Basic Usage

Let's dive into numbers.

~~~perl
my $numero = 42;
~~~

Easy enough. We can add numbers:

~~~perl
my $sum = $numero + 42;
~~~

which is of course the same as if we would have done:

~~~perl
my $doubling = 2 * $numero;
~~~

Similar like in other languages, there is a short hand for `$numero = $numero + 42`:

~~~perl
$numero += 42;
~~~

and similarly for other operations.
