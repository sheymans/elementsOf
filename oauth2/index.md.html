# Introduction

TODO

TODO: add link to book

Note that even though I use examples like _Bank Of America_ or _mint_, I use
them for illustration purposes. These companies will be doing things
differently as they operate in the _real world_. A concept I'm not directly
bothered with.

# The User Accesses A Resource Directly

You keep neat budgets, so you decide you want to check your transactions at
[Bank of America](https://bankofamerica.com). You open up your favorite browser
and you go to said site. You click _Sign-in_ and are presented with the
classical login form:

![Classical Login](./images/classic_login.png width=150px)

You faithfully enter your username and password and get to see all your
transactions of the past month. Both Whole Foods and Amazon got too much money
from you this month, again.

We'll your username/login combo, your _credentials_ and add to that:

!!! Tip
    OAuth 2 is not about credentials.

This example also sets the stage for identifying you (aka the human) with your
browser (your _user-agent_), we'll refer to you and your browser as one (at
this point in history, a fair assumption) and name you/your browser, the
_User_.

We will call _Bank of America_, the _Resource Owner_: they own your
transactions (the resource).

TODO: sequence diagram of interaction between _User_ and _Resource_.


# The User Does not access the Resource Directly

Say you are [mint](mint.com). How could mint solve this?

List the problems with this.

Solution. An OAuth 2 dance.

# The OAuth 2 Dance

## The Players

## The Dance

Explain the interaction and all the concepts.  (Why do I need authorization
tokens versus access tokens. What are refresh tokens)

## Does OAuth 2 Solve My Problems

Go back to the mint problems, list them, and describe for each of them how
OAuth solves/does not solve.
